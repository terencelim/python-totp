## Implementation in Python
A demo implementation of TOTP's using Python (packages Flask, pyotp, and qrcode in particular) running on Heroku was done as part of the project and is accessible at http://python-totp.herokuapp.com/. The source code is available at https://github.com/sahands/python-totp.
